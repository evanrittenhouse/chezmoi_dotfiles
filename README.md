1. Run `sudo install_packages.sh`.
2. If you want UI dependencies (fonts, etc.), run `sudo configure_system.sh`.

TODO

1. install nvm.fish (and npm) and the rest of fisher packages
2. have neovim automatically configure and install Python/JS+TS LSPs - also want neovim to automatically run PackerSync
3. Figure out issue with tmux's $PATH on different loads - this seems like it may be solved with `tmux set-environment -g PATH $PATH`
4. Figure out PATH differences between Ubuntu and macOS
